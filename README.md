# my-small-account

A small project that build with vanilla NodeJs

## About
This small project is really basic you put number in the input
and node will save it or updata in the to json file.
I'm also try my best to create a validation on both sides.

## Quick start
```bash
No need for 'npm install' just 'node .'

# Server on loclhost:3000
node .
```
